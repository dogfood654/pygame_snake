# pygame_snake
First try in pygame

This is where I followed several tutorials on building games using pygame.

Source:
Racecar - https://pythonprogramming.net/pygame-python-3-part-1-intro/
Snake - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/snake-game-in-python-using-pygame-module/

I will further revise on the materials.
My next objective is to create an AI to play the snake game.
